# 👋 Hi there! How's going? 😊

I'm Pawel, a programmer from 🇵🇱Poland.

<p>
  My journey as a developer started in <b>2014</b> when I was building simple HTML pages as a hobby to earn some 💰.

  The next step was WordPress, with which I spent some time creating entire websites from "0", including themes, plugins, dedicated integrations, security, optimizations, etc. In the meantime, I also started to develop more in the backend aspects, creating dedicated applications in Laravel & Symfony, in which I worked regularly in cooperation with **Docker** for the next years 👾

  In <b>2020</b>, I changed my technology stack and development path a bit, switching from PHP to **Node.js** and starting to work more closely with **AWS** and **Docker (Swarm)** 😈
</p>

<p>
  Since 2022, I have been looking more and more often at topics related to infrastructure things like Kubernetes, GitOps, automatization, etc. moving towards a CloudOps/DevOps role 👹 I'm most interested in automating processes, starting from a standard CI/CD for a project (e.g. for an application) and ending with provisioning the entire environment (e.g. K8s cluster with monitoring, GitOps, etc.) from a simple form 🤖
</p>
<p>
  The cloud environment is also one of my interests, which is why within the homelab I combined both the local and cloud environment (Terraform states, KMS, etc.).
  <br /> Currently, I have the most experience with AWS (most often occurs at work), but personally, mostly I'm using GCP for my homelab and other stuff.
</p>

I have decided to use a GH organization to better organize them (I don't like overly "general" monoliths).

At this moment all repositories are private but if you want to see them, just let me know 🎃

## Projects & contributions

### Kubernetes Helms

A long time ago, a friend recommended an interesting exporter to Prometheus for RouterOS metrics (MikroTik), but I couldn't find a sensible Helm for it, and I didn't want to maintain static manifests.
That's why my first publicly available Helm was created ;) It is actively maintained by me and I don't rule out that more will appear in the future 🪖

<a href="https://helm.vrs-factory.dev"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/check%20my%20helms-0f1689.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=helm&logoColor=white" alt="" /></a>

### Terraform Modules

Since we got to like Terraform, I started developing existing modules and creating my own modules, as well as my boilerplate. <br />Most of them have been prepared for specific cases, but the "Fork" option will always help 👹

<a href="https://github.com/orgs/vrs-factory/repositories?q=terraform-&type=all&language=&sort="><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/check%20modules-9619d2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white" alt="" /></a>

### Lead Docker

Working in one of the companies, an internal CLI tool was created, which facilitated, among others, working with Docker on a project, but it lacked some facilities that a friend included in his project, which I'm helping to develop. Say hello to LeDo 😈

### Symfony: The Fast Track

Symfony in its first versions had only documentation, but no official book was created that would allow beginners to pleasantly enter cooperation with the framework. In Symfony 5, the creator of the framework decided to publish an official book that would be available in many languages - translated by the developers themselves. <br />
I joined the project at the very beginning and to this day I help translate the Polish version of the book 📖

### Twitch Helix Provider for OAuth 2.0

A very simple package that allows to easily connect your Symfony application with Twitch via a Helix API.
Honestly, I don't have much time to maintain it by myself, but after checking <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/vertisan/oauth2-twitch-helix/stats">the number of downloads</a> by Composer and the activity of interested people, it should be available for a long time 🥰

<a href="https://github.com/vertisan/oauth2-twitch-helix"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20your%20stream-9146FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=twitch&logoColor=white" alt="" /></a>

### vCLI

Is it just me who sometimes doesn't feel like typing long commands, e.g. to commit something? Or click through the UI to add the currently playing Spotify song in some playlist(s)? Or search for a task on Jira with its number? ... Maybe it's just me 😅
<be />Many commands and scripts are still in sh/Bash but over time I'm moving more and more of them to my own CLI written in Go ;)

One day I will click "Change visibility" 🤙🏼

# 👋 Hi there! How's going? 😊

I'm Pawel, a programmer from 🇵🇱Poland.

<p>
My journey as a developer started in <b>2014</b> when I was building simple HTML pages as a hobby to earn some 💰.

The next step was WordPress, with which I spent some time creating entire websites from "0", including themes, plugins, dedicated integrations, security, optimizations, etc. In the meantime, I also started to develop more in the backend aspects, creating dedicated applications in Laravel & Symfony, in which I worked regularly in cooperation with **Docker** for the next years 👾

In <b>2020</b>, I changed my technology stack and development path a bit, switching from PHP to **Node.js** and starting to work more closely with **AWS** and **Docker (Swarm)**, which I still do today 😈
</p>

<p>
  Cloud technologies are an area that is very interesting to me and I'm also interested in going in that way. Currently, I have the most experience with AWS, but I'm also open to learning about GCP or Azure 👹
</p>

<p>Any questions? <b>Reach me out!</b></p>

## Projects & contributions

### Terraform Modules

Since we got to like Terraform, I started developing existing modules and creating my own modules, also my own boilerplate. <br />Most of them have been prepared for specific cases, but the "Fork" option will always help 👹

<a href="https://github.com/orgs/vrs-factory/repositories?q=terraform-&type=all&language=&sort="><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/check%20modules-9619d2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white" alt="" /></a>

### Lead Docker

Working in one of the companies, an internal CLI tool was created, which facilitated, among others, working with Docker in a project, but it lacked some facilities that a friend included in his project, which I'm helping to develop. Say hello to LeDo 😈

### Symfony: The Fast Track

Symfony in its first versions had only documentation, but no official book was created that would allow beginners to pleasantly enter cooperation with the framework. In Symfony 5, the creator of the framework decided to publish an official book that would be available in many languages - translated by the developers themselves. <br />
I joined the project at the very beginning and to this day I help translate the Polish version of the book 📖

### Twitch Helix Provider for OAuth 2.0

A very simple package that allows to easily connect your Symfony application with Twitch via a Helix API.
Honestly, I don't have much time to maintain it by myself, but after checking <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/vertisan/oauth2-twitch-helix/stats">the number of downloads</a> by Composer and the activity of interested people, it should be available for a long time 🥰

### vCLI

Is it just me who sometimes doesn't feel like typing long commands, e.g. to commit something? Or click through the UI to add the currently playing Spotify song in some playlist(s)? Or search for a task on Jira with its number?
Many commands and scripts are still in sh/Bash but over time I'm moving more and more of them to my own CLI written in Python using Click ;)

Currently, the repository is private due to a lot of confidential things 🫣
One day I will click "Change visibility" 🤙🏼
